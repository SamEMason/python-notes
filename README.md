# üêç Python Notes

This repository contains structured notes, code examples, and exercises from my Python learning journey. It begins with content from the [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/lecture/9407968#overview) by Jose Portilla, and will expand to include notes from additional courses and resources over time.

## üéØ Purpose

- Develop a strong understanding of Python programming.
- Track progress through each course section.
- Create a well-documented, personal reference for future Python work.
- Showcase knowledge and organization for others to learn from.
